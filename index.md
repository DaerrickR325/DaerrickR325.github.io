### CPSC 120

*Date Difference Calculator (Lab 07 Part-1)

    Lab 07 part-1 was a favorite because I thought it was really cool that I was able to code a program that could calculate the amount of time it has been when I input a start and end date. What I learned from this lab was that I am able to create code where I can input numbers and the program would create output statements.

*Philosopher Schedule (Lab 09 Part-2)

    Lab 09 part-2 was a favorite because the way the program would compare two strings in an interesting way. The program would check to see if there was the same letter "e" in the same spot. I enjoyed this lab because I could see how each line of code affected the outcome of the program. I learned how to use boolean to code when programming.

*Black Jack (Lab 06 Part-2)

    Lab 06 part 2 was a favorite because It was about the game blackjack which is one of my favoite games to play with friends and family. The assignment taught me how to code the game I love to play while teaching me how to program and it was challenging but fun. I learned problem solving skills and critical thinking using string.
